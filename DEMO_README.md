## 🚀 Quick Start - Day Before Demo

### Step 1: Prepare Your System

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
cd /path/to/Package-Script-Writer
chmod +x prepare-demo.sh
./prepare-demo.sh
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
cd C:\path\to\Package-Script-Writer
.\prepare-demo.ps1
```

This will:
- ✅ Verify PSW CLI is installed
- ✅ Prime the package cache
- ✅ Create demo workspace at `~/psw-demo-sydney/`
- ✅ Generate backup scripts
- ✅ Create sample templates
- ✅ Populate history
- ✅ Test network connectivity
- ✅ Create quick reference files

### Step 2: Review Demo Scenarios

Read through `DEMO_SCENARIOS.md` and choose which scenarios to include:

**Recommended flow (10-12 minutes)**:
1. Quick Win (30s) - `psw --default`
2. Interactive Magic (3-4min) - Full guided workflow
3. Power User (2min) - CLI automation examples
4. Team Templates (2min) - Template system
5. History Replay (1min) - History feature

**Adjust based on your audience**:
- Beginners? Focus on #1-2 (interactive mode)
- Developers? Emphasize #3 (CLI automation)
- Teams? Highlight #4 (templates)
- All audiences? Do all 5!

### Step 3: Print/Prepare Cheat Sheet

**Option A**: Print it
```bash
# macOS
open DEMO_CHEAT_SHEET.md  # Then print from preview

# Linux
libreoffice --headless --convert-to pdf DEMO_CHEAT_SHEET.md
lp DEMO_CHEAT_SHEET.pdf

# Windows
start DEMO_CHEAT_SHEET.md  # Then print from browser/editor
```

**Option B**: Second monitor
- Open `DEMO_CHEAT_SHEET.md` on your laptop screen
- Project main terminal to audience screen

### Step 4: Practice

Run through each scenario once:
```bash
cd ~/psw-demo-sydney

# Test default
psw --default

# Test interactive (Ctrl+C to exit)
psw

# Test CLI mode
psw -p "uSync,Diplo.GodMode" -n TestProject -s TestSolution

# Test templates
psw template list

# Test history
psw history list
```

## 🎨 Customization Tips

### Make It Your Own

These demos are templates - customize them:

**Project Names**: Use names relevant to Sydney
```bash
# Instead of "MyProject"
psw -n UmbracoSydney -s SydneyMeetup

# Or Sydney landmarks
psw -n SydneyHarbour -s OperaHouse
psw -n BondiCMS -s SydneyBeaches
```

**Packages**: Use packages your audience knows
```bash
# Popular in Australia
psw -p "uSync,Umbraco.Forms,Umbraco.Deploy"

# Popular community packages
psw -p "Diplo.GodMode,Umbraco.Community.BlockPreview,Contentment"
```

**Talking Points**: Add your personal experiences
- "I use this every time I start a new client project"
- "This saved me 2 hours last week when onboarding a new dev"
- "Our team has 5 different templates for different project types"

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Engagement
- **Ask questions** during waits: "Who uses uSync?"
- **Share stories**: "This saved me X hours last week"
- **Be authentic**: "Let's see if this works..." builds tension
- **Show personality**: Your enthusiasm is contagious!

### Technical
- **Use verbose mode** when educational: `PSW_VERBOSE=1 psw`
- **Show the files**: `cat script.sh` or open in editor
- **Explain as you go**: Don't just run commands silently
- **Compare approaches**: "Interactive vs CLI mode"

### Timing
- **Don't rush**: Better to do 3 scenarios well than 5 poorly
- **Watch the clock**: Have a simple watch/timer visible
- **Buffer time**: Leave 5min for Q&A
- **Cut if needed**: Skip history/templates if running long
